# README - Lab 3: Pac-Man Game

# Constructors and Operators Laboratory

## Purpose
The goal of this laboratory is to teach students how to **override operators** and familiarize themselves with the options for defining and using **constructors** in C++.  

Additionally, this lab prepares the project for the **use of the C++ Standard Library**.

## Task Description
This laboratory builds upon the previous lab assignment.  

For each data structure representing game elements, here is defined:

- **Default constructor**  
- **Copy constructor**  
- **Parameterized constructor**  
- **Assignment operator**  
- **Comparison operators**  
- **Input and output operators**  

For the class responsible for rendering game objects, students must define an **abstract base class**.

## Compilation
The project can be compiled from the command line using:

```bash
make
